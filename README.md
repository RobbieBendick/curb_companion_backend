# Curb Companion Backend
## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.
2. Grab the .env files. You can find this in the Discord, in the "environment-variables" text channel.
3. You will need the service account key for GCP.

Now, you can run npm i && npm run dev as docker is currently not supported.
